## **eItems**

## This is an offline file update to the Stockholm 2021 stickers. only update the sitckers、music-kit. but, if you  direct substitution it will not work,you need to change the "MAX_STICKERS"、"MAX_STICKERS_SETS" limit in \quasemago\csgo_weaponstickers\globals.inc, then recompile the main script . 
https://github.com/WE3CS/CSGO_WeaponStickers
## Since Valve last update， you also need to update the latest SM、 PTaH-V1.1.3 and RESTinPawn.

eItems is an API designed to provide extended information and functionality to the CSGO Item Economy.

Unlike CSGO_Items, there is no need to change the `SlowScriptTimeout` setting to higher number.

Requirements: [**REST in Pawn** - HTTP client for JSON REST APIs](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=298024)

Please, be aware that `ItemLog_eItems.smx` is meant only for **debugging functionality**. For this reason, it does not need to be uploaded to the server
